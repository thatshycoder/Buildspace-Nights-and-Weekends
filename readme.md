## Buildspace Nights and Weekends

<a href="https://buildspace.so/nights-weekends" target="_blank">Buildspace Nights and Weekends S1</a> is a 6 weeks sprint where selected builder come together to work on different project consistently for 6 weeks.

I applied so I could use the push to improve my web3 development skills.

To track my steps, I'd like to document my journey here.

## Day 1

I've been struggling to come up with an idea. I wanted to work on something simple, but meaningful. And also complex enough to make me improve different areas of my blockchain development skills(and software development skill as a whole).

I finially came up with an idea to work on the first day.

Drew a couple of sketches on how it should look.

## Day 2

Working on validating my idea and fully understanding it. I'm also try to come up with some mockups on how the UI/UX should be.

## Day 3

I'll be designing more mockups today.

## Day 4

Learned how to build a react native app, and brainstormed features of the idea.
